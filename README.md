# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in finance at Tilburg University. I want to graduate and find a job as an assistant professor in finance in a top business school or economic school. I am more like the "make the world a better place" kind of guy, but I do enjoy life very much, which means I would like to be financially independent.
